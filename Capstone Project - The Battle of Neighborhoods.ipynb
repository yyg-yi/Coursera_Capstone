    "There are lots of resaurants in Mahattan, but most of them have had a hard time since the impact of Covud-19. Some of them even had to close. So, we will try to dectec locations where the resaurant market is not so competitive. It will be better if we can find some place where are less Chinese resaurants. We also tend to choose locations near city centers, so that high traffic could help the resaurant attract more customers in the beginning and then survive during this pandamic."
